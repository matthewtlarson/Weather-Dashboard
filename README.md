# Weather-Dashboard
First I created a skeleton that resembled the mock-up;
Then I proceeded to add elements with id's and classes to reference later in CSS;
I linked the following documents: Javascript.js, bootstrap, css, and made sure these links were working;
I created buttons and a search tool for user input to link later in my javascript;
Then I finished building the skeleton and added styles into my css sheet;
After everything was styled correctly, I went into javascript and created my functions;
I made multiple functions to retrieve data from weathermap and got the data to present itself in my console based on user input;
Then I displayed the data from the user input, into my card element from HTML, creating a user friendly weather app.
